I am Xinnong Zhang (张辛农), a Ph.D. student at Fudan University. I'm currently advised by Prof. [Zhongyu Wei](http://www.fudan-disc.com/people/zywei) and carrying out my research at the [Data Intelligence and Social Computing Lab (Fudan DISC)](http://www.fudan-disc.com/). My email is xnzhang23 AT m DOT fudan DOT edu DOT cn.

### Research Interests

Currently, I'm excited about the following topics:
- Bootstrapping Computational Social Science via Large Vision Language Models
- Agents Simulation Powered by Large Language Models

### What's New

\[2024.10.29\] **[AI-Press](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07561)**, **[AgentSense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19346)**, and **[ElectionSim](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20746)**, altogether **three** new works are now released! It's been quite tough days and now I'm planning on a vacation : )
